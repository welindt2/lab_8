```

```{r}
View(star)
```

```{r commit 3}
star %>% 
  group_by(sex, frl) %>% 
  summarize(math_mean = mean(tmathss, na.rm = TRUE),
            math_sd = sd(tmathss, na.rm = TRUE),
            rdg_mean = mean(treadss, na.rm = TRUE), 
            rdg_sd = sd(treadss, na.rm = TRUE))

```
The table shows the mean math and reading scores separated by sex and frl (?), as well as the standard deviations for these scores.

Two of my favorite citation examples in different formats are @hammitt_admissible_2013 and of course [@barsky_preference_1997]. Bangers.
